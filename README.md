## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about responsiveness across devices and the CSS property:value pair "margin-bottom: auto". Additionally, I was able to refresh my memory on the difference between HTML anchor and button tags. Finally, I learned a neat shortcut for Windows to copy text from an image (Windows-Shift-T).

```html
<div class="button">
  <a href="#">Learn More</a>
</div>
```

```css
.category:first-child {
  background-color: var(--Bright-orange);
  border-top-left-radius: 12px;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 12px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to explore ways to make the button text transparent and also have the background JUST under that text transparent as well.

### Useful resources
